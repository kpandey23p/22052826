# Backend Microservices Project

This repository contains two backend microservices developed to solve distinct problems using RESTful APIs. Each microservice is housed in its own folder with independent setup and functionality.

## Folder Structure
- **`average-calculator/`**: A microservice that fetches numbers from a third-party server and computes their average based on specified types.
- **`social-media-analytics/`**: A microservice providing real-time analytics for social media data, including user and post insights.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- Git
- An API client (e.g., Postman or Insomnia) for testing

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
